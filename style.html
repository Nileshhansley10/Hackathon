           <h2>Most Trusted Pet<br> Sitters, Dog Walkers,<br> Dog Trainers - Our<br> Story<br><br></h2>
           
           <p>Our CEO missed his childhood pet, a Shetland Sheepdog named Larry. Given his busy schedule, he was worried about committing to a dog of his own and his family and friends convinced him that it wouldn't be fair. The more he thought about it, though, the more passionate he became about making dog ownership easier for busy people like him.</p><br>

           <p>Using his background in building consumer tech companies and scaling them to millions of users, he founded DOGGO! with the mission to make it easier to own a dog. Our goal is to be your dog's button on your phone.Now you can rest easy because we only hire permanent employees with years of experience in animal hospitals, shelters, rescue, fostering, and dog training.</p>
